I am a Full Stack Software Engineer studying at Pursuit, which is an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 8% acceptance rate. As a software engineer, what keeps me going is being put in new situations and learning from them to grow my problem solving skills. I am passionate about gaming and creating enjoyable interactive user experiences. My interests outside of coding include PC gaming in which I primarily play MMORPGs, karaoke, anime, movies, and running. What I'm looking for next in my career is an opportunity to flex my creative muscles in software engineering and applying the skills that I acquired throughout my 6 years of experience in tech, having worked at companies including Facebook, Publicis Groupe, and GroupM.

Skills: JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, React/Redux, PosgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Node.js, APIs, VCS, Git, Github, CLI, Unit Testing, Data Structures, Algorithms, Sprints, Agile, code reviews, and pair programming.
